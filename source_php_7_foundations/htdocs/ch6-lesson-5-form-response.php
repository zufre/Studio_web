		<?php

		/*
			There are a bunch of predefined (precreated) variables in PHP that are called" "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, 
			class or file without having to do anything special.

			Note: classes are basically objects, and these are packages of code that contain funtions, variables and more. 

			The PHP superglobal variables are:

		    $GLOBALS
		    $_SERVER
		    $_REQUEST
		    $_POST
		    $_GET
		    $_FILES
		    $_ENV
		    $_COOKIE
		    $_SESSION

		    To process forms, we use $_POST and $_GET

		$name =  $_POST["name"];
		$password = $_POST["password"];

		if($password != "qwerty") {

			echo "No access for you buddy!";

		} else {

			echo "The secret answer is: crackers";
		}
